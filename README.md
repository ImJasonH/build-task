# Shipwright Custom Task for Tekton

## What?

This controller watches for Custom Task `Run`s that reference a Shipwright `Build`, and responds by creating a `BuildRun`.
It then also watches `BuildRun`s owned by `Run`s, and updates the associated `Run` with `BuildRun` status information.

## Why?

Two reasons:

1. To integrate with Tekton Triggers, which is configured to only create Tekton
   resources (including `Run`s), but which cannot create `BuildRun`s directly.
1. To integrate with Shipwright image build workflows with `PipelineRun`s directly;
   this allows a Pipeline author to request a Shipwright BuildRun as part of their Pipeline.

## Demo

### Prerequisites:

1. Install Tekton
1. Install Shipwright
1. Install the Custom Task controller using [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko): `ko apply -f controller.yaml`

First, we'll define a Build config:

```
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: my-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/dockersamples/node-bulletin-board
    contextDir: bulletin-board-app
  strategy:
    name: kaniko
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  output:
    image: quay.io/blah/blah
```

`kubectl apply -f build.yaml` ([`build.yaml`](./build.yaml))

This build will pull a public GitHub repo, attempt to build it with Kaniko, then fail because it doesn't have push permissions, but that's okay because we can at least see it happen.

Then, we'll define a `Run` config that runs the Build:

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Run
metadata:
  generateName: build-run-
spec:
  ref:
    apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Build
    name: my-build
```

`kubectl create -f run.yaml` ([`run.yaml`](./run.yaml))

Now we can see the `Run` progress:

```
$ kubectl get runs -w
NAME              SUCCEEDED   REASON    STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
build-run-sghl7   Unknown     Pending   2s          
build-run-sghl7   Unknown     Running   4s          
build-run-sghl7   False       Failed    7s          0s
```

As expected the `Run` started, ran, and failed.

Let's see the underlying BuildRun it created.

```
$ kubectl get run build-run-sghl7 -ojsonpath="{.status.extraFields.buildRunName}"
build-run-sghl7-buildrun-b5sl5
$ kubectl get buildrun build-run-sghl7-buildrun-b5sl5
NAME                             SUCCEEDED   REASON   STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
build-run-sghl7-buildrun-b5sl5   False       Failed   28s         22s
```
